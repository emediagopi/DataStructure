Linked list can be created to manage data dynamically. 

## Node
Each node in a linked list contains some data and a reference to the next node.

## Structure
A class can be created to handle operations like add, remove and traverse the nodes

## Usage
### Dynamic Data Storage
    Advantage: An application that require dynamic memory management since they do not need a fixed size.
    Use Cases: In scenarios where data is frequently added and removed, such as playlists, undo/redo functionalities, and task scheudling.

### Stack and Queues
    Advantage: Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) can be efficently implemented
    Use Cases: Task scheduling, order processing, and breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms in graphs commonly use stack and queues.

### Efficient Insertions and Deletions
    Advantage: It allow constant time insertions and deletions from the begining or end (depending on if it's singly or doubled linked list).
    Use Cases: When dealing with large datasets that require frequent additions and deletions (such as event handling systems or real-time applications).

### Graph and Tree representations
    Advantage: Linked list form the backbone of many graph and tree structures bacuse they allow flexible and dynamic connections between nodes.
    Use Cases: Graph adjacency lists are commonly represented as linked lists, where each node has a list of nodes to which it's connected. Tree structures like binary search trees and other hierarchial structures also often use linked lists to store child nodes efficently.

### Circular list 
    Advantage: It allow the last node to point back to the head, creating a closed loop.
    Use Cases: In applications like round-robin scheduling, multiplayer game, or continuous data cysling (ex: media player playlists)

### Implementing Hash Tables (Seprate Chaining)
    Advantage: It often used in hash tables to handle collisions though seprate chaining. When two or more keys hash to the same index, they are stored in a linked list at that index, making it possible to handle collisions dynamically.
    UseCases: Widely used in databses, caches, and dictionaries

### Memory-Efficient Data Structure
    Advantage: It allow for non-contiguous storage in memory, whic can be more memory-efficient when dealing with sparse data structures or when memory is fragmented.
    Use Cases: Memory-efficient applications, such as application in embedded systems or devices with limited memory, can benifit from the flexibility of linked lists in managing sparse or variable-sized data.

### Data Buffers
    Advantage: Efficent way to manage data buffers for real-time streaming applications since they allow data to be dynamically added and removed.
    Use Cases: Application like video or audio streaming services, network data packets, or file I/O buffers

## Types 
### Singly Linked List
#### Head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Null
#### Structure
    Each node has two parts: data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node.
#### Use Cases
    Basic dynamic data storage where data needs to added or removed from the list.
    Implementing simple stack and queues

### Doubly Linked List
#### Head -> Null <- Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 -> Null
#### Structure
    Each node has three parts: data, a reference to the next node and a reference to the previous node.
#### Use Cases
    Applications that needs to move in both directions, such as navigating back and forth in a browser history
    More complex operations that require flexibility in data access, like implementng undo/redo features

### Circular Linked List
#### Head -> Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 -> Head (Circular)
#### Structure
    Similar to a singly Linked list, but the last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.
#### Use Cases
    Applications that require cyclic data processing, such as a round-robin task scheduler
    Implementing a looped playlist in media players where the list restarts after reaching the end.

### Doubly Circular Linked List
#### Head <-> Node1 <-> Node2 <-> Node3 <-> Head (Circular)
#### Structure
    Combines features of both circular and doubly linked lists. 
#### Use Cases
    Implementing complex data structures like the carousel of times in a UI that can move both forward and backward seamlessly 
    Multiplayer games where player take turns, allowing players to loop back to the beginning after each round.

### Skip List
#### (Layered structure with nodes at different levels pointing forward in steps to "skip" intermediate nodes)
#### Structure
    A layered, indexed version of a linked list. Multiple layers or levels are created, where each level skips over multiple nodes of the previous level, allowing for faster search operations.
#### Use Cases
    Database indexing for faster lookups and range queries
    Implementing associative arrays, sorted lists, or dynamic sets where efficiency in search and insertion is needed

### Unrolled Linked List
#### Structure
    Each node (or block) contains an array of elements and a pointer to the next block. This reduces the memory overhead by storing multiple elements in each node.
#### Use Cases
    Implementing high performace text editors where large chunks of data are managed in blocks.
    Data structures needing low pointer overhead with faster access times, like applications handling large datasets.

### Self Adjusting (e.g., Move-to-Front)
#### Structure
    A linked list that reorders itself based on access patterns, typically moving accessed nodes to the front.
#### Use Cases
    Caching systems where recently accessed data should be more accessible.
    Implementing data structures with locality of reference, like frequently accessed cache elements.
    





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
